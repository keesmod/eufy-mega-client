# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-10

- Independent Mega authentication, session persistence and discovery for the
  initial T8030/T8160/T8213 installation.
- Explicit LAN connection credentials, with no legacy cloud API fallback.
- Library-owned typed device, event, snapshot, live, recording and Guard Mode APIs.
- Device acknowledgement and telemetry checks for stop, transfer completion and
  Guard Mode. Cancellation and shutdown retain cleanup ownership.
- FCM reconnection and persisted duplicate suppression.
- Allow delayed first AAC packets within a bounded three-second audio discovery
  window; start immediately once both media types are identified.
- MIT attribution, protocol tests and compiled GitHub package distribution.

Hardware and HA acceptance passed on the target installation, including the
agreed 11-hour-26-minute overnight observation. This does not establish full
24-hour reliability or improved battery life. See the compatibility results.
